    <b>You will need:</b>
    <ol>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup <a href="unsweetened.html">unsweetened</a> cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup of cold milk</li>
        <li>½ cup sunflower oil emulsified with ½ cup of hot water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp of coffee power (optional)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3> 

        1. Preheat oven to 180ºC. Grease and flour a 14-inch baking pan and line them with parchment circles.<br>
        2. In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. <br>
        3. In another large bowl beat the eggs, milk, emulsified oil, coffee power and vanilla extract. <br>
        4. Once fully combined, slowly sieve in the half of the dry ingredients and beat on medium speed until fully combined then sieve in the rest of the dry ingredients and beat till batter forms, about 30 seconds. Pause to scrape down sides and bottom of mixer bowl as well as the paddle. Beat 15 seconds more, until mixture is mostly smooth. <br>
        5. Pour batter into the pan and bake on middle rack of oven for 25-35 minutes. <br>
        6. Allow to cool 15 minutes in pans, then run a butter knife around the edges of each cake. Line the cooling rack with parchment paper. <br>
        7. Place a cooling rack over top of the pan. Wearing oven mitts, use both hands to hold the rack in place while flipping the cake over onto the rack. Set the rack down and gently thump on the bottom of the pan until the cake release. Cool completely before handling or frosting.
