    <h2>Unsweetened</h2>
    
    <p><b>Meaning:</b> with no sugar or other sweet substances added</p>
    <p>Cacao or cocoa, derived from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels, manifests in various forms – liquid, solid, or paste. Whether enjoyed independently or employed as a flavor enhancer in diverse culinary creations, chocolate has a rich history spanning at least 5,300 years. Its consumption dates back to the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in present-day Ecuador, with later civilizations in Mesoamerica relishing chocolate beverages before its introduction to Europe in the 16th century.

        The cacao tree's seeds possess an intensely bitter taste necessitating fermentation for flavor development. Post-fermentation, the seeds undergo drying, cleaning, and roasting. The removal of the shell yields cocoa nibs, subsequently ground into cocoa mass – unadulterated chocolate in a coarse state. Upon liquefaction through heating, it transforms into chocolate liquor, which can further be processed into cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, known as bitter chocolate, comprises varying proportions of cocoa solids and cocoa butter without added sugar. Alternatively, powdered baking cocoa, richer in fiber than cocoa butter, can undergo alkali processing to yield Dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today takes the form of sweet chocolate, blending cocoa solids, cocoa butter, or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate, a sweet variant, incorporates milk powder or condensed milk, while white chocolate consists of cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, devoid of cocoa solids.
        
        Renowned as one of the world's most beloved flavors, chocolate permeates various foodstuffs, notably desserts like cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Candies are frequently filled or coated with sweetened chocolate, while chocolate bars – either pure or incorporating diverse ingredients coated in chocolate – serve as popular snacks. Chocolate gifts molded into assorted shapes, such as eggs, hearts, or coins, are traditional on Western holidays like Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. Additionally, chocolate finds its place in both cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, as well as certain alcoholic drinks, like creme de cacao.</p>
